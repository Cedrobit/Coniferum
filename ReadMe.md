# Coniferum
> A full-fledged simplistic, lightweight, and usable Operating System written within a high-level graphical programming language.
## Summary
> [!NOTE]
> Coniferum is currently in development, specifically in Version 0.0.0. Coniferum isn't done yet, so do keep in mind for instabilities within the Operating System. If you find an issue, please contact me at "cedrobit@outlook.com"; Thanks!

Coniferum is an Operating System written within the Scratch programming language designed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; fit with list-based filesystems and a virtual Random Access Memory system, this Operating System is unique and is currently in alpha-stage development. Currently, only a single component (the virtual firmware interface) is being developed, but gradually as development progresses, more components like a kernel will be implemented.
## Progress
> [ #................... ] 2% Done

As a refresher, Coniferum is currently in Version 0.0.0; the first release. It's still a prototype, so features implemented here may not be present when the actual project starts. Here's a list of stuff to do during development of the prototype.

### Phase #1
> This period lasts from February 14th, 2025  ~  March 2nd, 2025

**Goal:** Make adequate resources to begin Coniferum development.
- [x] Set up the project's structure.
- [x] Make a development checklist.
- [x] Develop a kit for branding and the like.

### Phase #2
> This period lasts from March 4th, 2025  ~  April 4th, 2025

**Goal:** Complete Arbor by the end of this period.
- [x] Develop a basic text engine capable of rendering regular and bold-styled text.
- [ ] Enhance the text engine with italic and underline support.
- [x] Implement the "vRAM" system.
- [ ] Make a process list to peek at currently running processes.
- [ ] Implement a way to begin and kill processes.
- [ ] Create a dummy kernel that Arbor can boot.
- [ ] Support Multi-Booting.
- [ ] Add more glyphs to the text engine and features like color.
